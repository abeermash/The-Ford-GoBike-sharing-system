by Abeer AL-Mashjari

### Overview of the data:

I Gather the data localy after downloading it from the website: https://s3.amazonaws.com/baywheels-data/index.html provided by udacity. Basically I focused on different user type behavior.
The data consist of approximately 1,85M bike rides from JAN-MAY 2019. The attributes include the trip start/end time, start/end station, duration in seconds as well as additional information such as user type, gender, date of birth .

### Summary of data exploration

in the exploration, I found that the Ford gobike system works from San Francisco to rint bikes for two types of clients using the system: Subscribers and Customers.
Later I foucsed on the behavef of each user types by investigate distributions of individual variables in univariate ,bivariate and multivariate data expolration  and the result was  :
- Subscribers are the main users by  88.6% of all riders and most of bike rides are around the peak hours 8-9am and 5-6pm ,mostly rent in march and the most gender are the adult males there age around 20-40.
-Customers are making 11.4% of the membership , usually considered as tourists. They uesd it around 8-9am and 5-6pm ,in march and the most are also adult males there age around 20-40. 
    

### Key insights

For the presentation, I focued on customer behavour and how each user type used the system in 2019.  I start by introducing the split between the suscribers and customers giving information of the most popoular type uesd the system then get into detailes about the rang of age and the gender of the member . Afterwards, I move to monthly habits and the peak hour . Finally, I used the heatmap to show all the information about the user type duration trip per gender and age  to show the differences in renting behaviour.
